                <h3>Why you should switch your career to cybersecurity.</h3>
                <h4>Cybersecurity, Jobs, Entry Level, Growth</h4>
                <p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Contemplating a career switch but don't know which direction to take. The difficult part of that
                   decision is finding a career that will continue to leverage you professionally, competitively
                   compensate you and keep your sanity all while doing a job that will give you a sense of fulfillment.
                   Switching careers can be tough but could be worth it given you decide the right career path. The
                   reason I decided to switch my career to cybersecurity is because of the increasing demand for
                   cybersecurity professionals and the importance of protecting our digital assets in our modern
                   interconnected world. Cybersecurity professionals play a critical role in protecting individuals and
                   organizations from cyber threats. I wanted to play an important role that would provide a sense of
                   purpose and satisfaction. Here are a few factors I considered while switching to cybersecurity:
                   1. Industry Growth: The industry of technology and cybersecurity is experiencing rapid growth and is
                   projected to grow even more within 10 years. Cybersecurity also offers an expansive range of job
                   opportunities. With cyber threats on the rise, especially after COVID19, organizations across all
                   sectors are investing heavily in taking the proper precautions and security measures to protect their
                   company.
                   2. Job Security: With the pivot of the modern workforce switching to remote, there has been a significant
                   increase in cyber threats. With the increase in cyber threats, there's a need for skilled professionals to
                   defend against them. That alone attributes to why cybersecurity professionals are high in demand. The
                   higher demand translates into career advancement and greater job security.
                   3. Competitive compensation: The increased demand has led to competitive salaries and benefits. With the
                   right certifications, experience, and even networking, an individual can  ^`^|write their own ticket ^`^}
                   and command a profitable compensation package.
                   4. Continuous Learning: The field of cybersecurity is forever evolving which requires professionals to stay
                   current and up to date with all the latest technological trends and threats. The scope of cybersecurity
                   is all about modernization and innovation so If your someone who enjoys learning and tackling new challenges,
                   cybersecurity will offer a fulfilling career.

                   This list is just a few factors but could go on for days. I had the greatest opportunity to be admitted to
                   UNC-Charlotte Cybersecurity Bootcamp program which was by far the greatest decision I ^`^yve made. While it is
                   challenging and tests your critical thinking skills, it ^`^ys great in the sense that you get real-world,
                   hands-on experience. Transitioning your career could be a difficult task but the result and reward when you
                   finally do will be well worth it in the end.

                <h3>Artificial Intelligence. Is it the future of cybersecurity?</h3>
                <h4>AI, Articial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Prevention, Detection, Cyber Threat </h4>
                <p>
                    	The future is now, and the importance of the role Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays in cybersecurity is
                    substantial. As cyber threats and attacks intensify post pandemic, the traditional strategies seemingly fall
                    behind the new and improved age of ransomware, malware and hacking attempts. Businesses and organizations are
                    now in pursuit of efficient and effective ways to identify, prevent, counteract and respond to cyber threats.
                    Utilizing software with artificial intelligence improves security measures by proactively protecting systems
                    via flagging and alerting any activity with malicious intent. AI has three primary functions including
                    prediction to identify vulnerabilities, detection by sending notifications to prevent an attack, and response
                    to fight and stop attacks in real time. When programmed, AI software can detect and eliminate potential threats
                    minus the need for an individual to intervene.  Cybersecurity professionals now take numerous approaches to
                    utilize the benefit of AI such as, machine learning-assisted hacking tools, machine learning-assisted malware
                    analysis, and intrusion detection systems. Keeping up with technological changes is the key to preventing attacks
                    as cybercriminals are upping their game. AI is now used across the spectrum from cybercriminals utilizing for their
                    personal criminal activities, to cybersecurity professionals defending systems and networks against malicious
                    attacks. So, is artificial intelligence the future of cybersecurity? It will play a crucial role in the future of
                    cybersecurity but by no means is it perfect, yet. As cybercriminals become more sophisticated in attacks, it ^`^ys
                    prominent to stay ahead by constantly innovating and adapting security measures. I personally don ^`^yt think relying
                    solely on AI, without human intervention, to prevent or respond to attacks is a legitimate solution. As with anything,
                    errors and false positives could cause obstacles or further damage. A combination of using AI learning algorithms and
                    predictive analysis tools with human proficiency and knowledge, can build a strong defense against cyber threats.
